| `references` | The sources an article cites — its bibliography: each citation's text plus the off-wiki URLs it points to (DOI, publisher, archive, primary-source links); the verification companion to `external_links` |
| `revision_diff` | Compare two revisions of an article — plain-text unified diff of what a specific edit changed, each side labelled with timestamp, editor, and edit summary |
| `disambiguation` | Resolve a disambiguation page into its candidate articles — title + one-line description, grouped by section; pick the right one, then fetch it |
| `user_contribs` | What a Wikipedia editor has been doing — latest contributions by a username or IP (timestamp, byte delta, edit comment, new-page/minor/current flags), with registration date + total edit count; profile contributors or audit anonymous IPs |
| `citation_needed` | Find statements Wikipedia has flagged as needing a source — pass `article` to extract its tagged claims (with tag dates), or `topic` for articles with unsourced claims on a topic; the verification companion to `references` |
| `talk` | Read an article's talk page — the most recently active editor discussion threads, each with heading, last-activity timestamp, signed-comment count, and an excerpt of the latest comment; automated notices filtered out — the behind-the-scenes companion to `contributors` and `article_quality` |
| `article_flags` | Show the maintenance banners editors placed on an article — {{POV}}, {{Original research}}, {{Unreferenced}}, {{Cleanup}}, {{Disputed}} and more, each with tag date, location (article top or section), and a plain-language meaning; the trust-signal companion to `article_quality`, `citation_needed`, and `talk` |
| `article_protection` | Is this Wikipedia article locked — which actions are restricted (editing, moving/renaming, creating), at what level (semi-protection, extended-confirmed, administrators-only), and when each restriction expires; follows redirects; the lockdown companion to the other trust signals |
| `article_pulse` | Vital signs of an article — creation date + creator, page length, watcher count, most recent edit, and edit velocity over the last 30 days, with a plain-language activity verdict (buzzing / active / quiet / dormant); the liveliness companion to `article_quality`, `contributors`, `revisions`, and `pageviews` |
| `citation_sources` | Which publishers an article's evidence comes from — its references aggregated by source domain into a ranked publisher map with per-domain share, plus archived-copy and DOI-linked scholarly shares and a plain-language verdict (diverse / balanced / top-heavy / lopsided / thin); the diversity companion to `references`, `article_quality`, `article_flags`, and `citation_needed` |
| `article_path` | Find the shortest click-path between two articles — the six-degrees game: searches Wikipedia's link graph for the shortest chain of blue links (1–3 hops, bidirectional and bounded), follows redirects; the discovery companion to `links` and `backlinks` |
| `article_at_date` | Show what an article said on a given date — the time machine: given a title and a YYYY-MM-DD date, returns the lead text of the latest surviving revision at or before that day, with revision ID, timestamp, editor, edit summary, and a permanent link to the exact revision; follows redirects; the history companion to `summary`, `revisions`, and `revision_diff` |
| `wanted_articles` | Articles Wikipedia doesn't have yet — ranked by demand: the most-wanted missing articles (redlinks) on a language Wikipedia by incoming-link count, article namespace only, template-driven redlink clusters collapsed; the discovery companion to `top_reads` and `recent_changes` |

All tools accept an optional `lang` parameter (one of: `en`, `de`, `es`, `fr`, `ja`, `zh`, `pt`, `it`, `ru`, `nl`), except `media_search` — Wikimedia Commons is language-independent, so it takes no `lang` — and `simple_summary`, which always reads Simple English Wikipedia. Note: `quote` accepts the parameter for API consistency but is currently English-only (curated list).

## Setup

This is a standard MCP server — it works with any MCP client (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.).

### Any MCP client

Add to your client's MCP config (e.g. `~/.claude.json`, or Cursor's `mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "wikipedia": {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["/path/to/wikipedia-mcp/src/server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

Then restart your client (or reload its MCP servers) to pick it up.

### OpenClaw (via mcporter)

Add the same `mcpServers` block to `~/.openclaw/workspace/config/mcporter.json`, then restart the gateway:

```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```
